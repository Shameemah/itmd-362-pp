# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/interaction/data-entry/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: In the sketch, there are hints present in the input fields to help communication purposes. 
	Also, the login button appears to enable advancement only when the required information has been entered.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/layout/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Alignment is used to make the page easy on the eye. 
Also, primary content is is clear and visible at the default size.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742478(v=vs.85).aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Bold is used sparingly and no italics are used at all. Question marks are present
at the end of questions. Main instructions are very clear and visible.
