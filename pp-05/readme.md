## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=53A0x0kvovchLHLnSyYwfmOEIft
Your Rationale: Gaming consoles are usually a form of relaxation for most people. Cool colors such as greens and blues
create a relaxing and calm vibe.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=32I0s0kwKzD3iObkl-KGynMUve3
Your Rationale: Spring is associated with bright, beautiful and vibrant colors. Green is the most common color associated with
plants. And magenta and orange complement green in a way that creates a beautiful contrast; much like the contrast between
roses, daisies and green grass.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=40W0l0kGvvvfcKPqzEQKGmtTibV
Your Rationale: The color blue is usually associated with security. The mustard color reminds me of the 
traditional padlock, which is also associated with security.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=15s0h0kwcn4fB-NqotEI-gfWt6m
Your Rationale: The palette is centered around the color ruby because the course is on Ruby on Rails. The palette is also
strongly aligned with the Ruby on Rails logo.
