# Production Problem 10: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on a website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)
The iterface component of the Bank of America website I focused on is the Sign In form. For my modification, I moved the sign in form to
the centre of the page, and made the components larger and more easy to access. The HTML I will need to write includes a form tag, with 3
inout elements. 2 text inputs and one submit button. The CSS will require using padding to ensure that the inout elements
are big enough for easy accessibility, and the use of a base grid to ensure that everything aligns nicely. The JavaScript will include
some JQuery to show or hide the log in button depending on the kind of input entered.
