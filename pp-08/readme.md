# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), 
take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and 
reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s 
emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: This can be seen in the sleek, clean and elegant nature in which the mouse was designed.

* Behavioral: The mouse allows users to use several different finger gestures, and each gesture provides a different funtion.

* Reflective: The experience of using this mouse is more pleasurable as compared to the regular mouse. 

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Suitable color choices and elegance
2. An easy and pleasurable experience when using our redesigned portal
3. Each element on the page should serve a specific function
